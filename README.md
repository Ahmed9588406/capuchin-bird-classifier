# capuchin-bird-classifier
building a deep audio classifier that classify capuchinbird from an Audio and doing several audio preprocessing for different audio format building a custom model that convert the wave form to spectrogram so we can use convelution neural network to work with that
I showed every thing i did in comments

## Where to start
I have provided some starter code that downloads the training set, builds a simple model and arrives at a simple count of calls per clip. All three phases can be tweaked and improved from including additional audio clips in the training set to building more complex models to more complex Capuchinbird call counting code. More generally there are some good resources that I would suggest to learn more about audio recognition which will be provided below.
